<h3>About us</h3>
<img src="images/women.jpeg" width="600px">
<p>Miles ahead is an organisation that came together after seeing how much women and young girls suffer in rural areas and informal settlements to an extent they cannot afford essential things like innerwears,pads, and sanitary wears.
    On numerous research, we found that even in rural areas and informal settlements, most of the jobs are male-dominated and very fewwomen venture into bead-work as a passtime rather than as an income generating activity.
  At Miles-Ahead, we strive to bring down those barriers and pave way for these women and young girls to be able to become self-reliant, in that, they are able to generate their own income with zero to minimal capital as all materials
are recycled, thus creating jobs and conserving the environment at the same time.Mental health of these women and children is also a priority.Most people assume that teenagers go through puberty and thus they act up.We realise that women and young girls go through mental health issues and so we try as much as we can to get involved in their mental well being.
</p>
<h3>WHAT WE DO</h3>
<P>Miles ahead has people who are experience in community based workshops and can relate very well with the issues faced in rural ans informal settlements.Through our contacts on the ground and online,we do research to find out where these valnerable and people are, we then go and talk to them about what we do and find out if they are interested.
Once we come to an agreement,we then set a date to go and do material gathering mostly born and horns. </P>
